This is the code for my personal website [https://maximchiao.me](https://maximchiao.me).

I built it with Angular, Bootstrap, and Firebase as the backend.

The Angular app is tied to a Firebase Real Time Database so it will update in real time when I make a change to one of the entries. The information from the work experiences, skills, and projects sections are all pulled from Firebase. 

I am planning to keep making changes to my website as I learn more and change my aesthetic.
