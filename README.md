## Welcome to My GitHub Page!
Follow along as I try to figure out how everything works!

This webapp was built with Angular and Bootstrap, with Firebase as the backend.

This is my first attempt at using web frameworks and Firebase together. The work experiences, skills, and project sections are all pulled from Firebase and will update in real time. 

There is a to-do list/road map at the bottom of the page for whoever is interested in what direction I am planning to take my website in the future.
