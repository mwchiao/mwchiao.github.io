                <h2>Deloiite Consulting</h2>
                <p>Tenure: <time datetime="2021-02">February 2021</time> to Present</p>
                <p>As a software engineering consultant, I use a variety of technologies like Drupal, PHP, JavaScript, and ServiceNow to aid in the digital transformation of public sector clients.</p> 
                <p>I led the development team responsible for managing the Drupal sites of a DHS client, where I was responsible for updating the sites' modules, coordinating upgrades with the infrastructure team, creating custom modules, and onboarding new team members. On the back-end side, I wrote shell scripts to automate common developer tasks and helped stand up a Jenkins instance for their mobile application CI/CD pipeline.<p>
                <p>I created web forms and automated backend processing with ServiceNow to transition a DoD client from paper reimbursement forms to digital forms, saving hundreds of emails and streamlining the approval process. I also developed portals and pages where both approvers and requestors can track the status of their request tickets.</p>

                <h2>University of California, Davis</h2>
                <p>Tenure: <time datetime="2019-06">June 2019</time> to <time datetime="2021-01">January 2021</time></p>
                <p>As a ServiceNow developer within UC Davis' Information and Educational Technology Department, I used AngularJS and the NOW Platform to create the new portal landing and software catalog pages for the university's ServiceHub. I improved the accessibility on ServiceHub by implementing accessibility best practices like visual contrast and keyboard navigation to the web app. I also helped implement responsive design so the web app functioned on a variety of screen sizes and added the ServiceNow virtual agent ot the portal to promote self-service and free up time from help desk analysts.</p>
                <p>The team I was a part of also won the <a class="external" href="https://www.ucdavis.com/news/uc-davis-wins-2-golds-it-innovation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sautter Golden Award for IT Innovation</a> for our efforts on ServiceHub.</p>
